```

```{r include=FALSE}
require(tidyverse)
require(tigerstats)
davisdata <- read.csv(file="UCDavis.csv")
```
## Our Goal is to answer this question Is there a difference between the alcohol consumed between the row
## you choose to sit in??

## Now with ggplot - first select the basic data

```{r}
basicCN <- ggplot(davisdata,aes(y=alcohol,x=Seat))
```
## Now add in boxplot

```{r}
boxplot(alcohol~Seat,data=davisdata)
```
  
 The boxes are not disjointed. The back box the median is higher than the front and middle box, The front and the middle box are similar in size but there are more outliers in the middle box.
